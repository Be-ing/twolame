NAME
----
twolame - an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder


SYNOPSIS
--------
'twolame' [options] <infile> [outfile]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
TwoLAME is an optimised MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder based on tooLAME by 
Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10 code and portions of 
LAME.

Encoding is performed by the libtwolame library backend. The twolame frontend can be used to encode audio files to MPEG Audio Layer 2 on the command line.

Input File
~~~~~~~~~~
TwoLAME uses libsndfile for reading the input sound file, so
the input file can be in any format supported by libsndfile. 
To read raw PCM audio from STDIN, then use - as the input filename.


Output File
~~~~~~~~~~~
If no output filename is specified, then suffix of the input filename 
is automatically changed to .mp2. To write the encoded audio to STDOUT 
then use - as the output filename.


Input Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-r, --raw-input::
	Speicies that input is raw 16-bit signed PCM audio.
	If audio is stereo, than audio samples are interleaved 
	between the two channels.

-x, --byte-swap::
	Force byte-swapping of the input. Endian detection is performed 
	automatically by libsndfile, so this option shouldn't 
	normally be needed.

-s, --samplerate <int>::
	If inputting raw PCM sound, you must specify the sample rate of 
	the audio in Hz. Default sample rate is 44100Hz.

-N, --channels <int>::
	If inputting raw PCM sound, you must specify the number of channels 
	in the input audio. Default number of channels is 2.

-g, --swap-channels::
	Swap the Left and Right channels of a stereo input file.

--scale <float>::
	Scale the input audio prior to encoding.
	All of the input audio is multiplied by specified value.
	Value between 0 and 1 will reduce the audio gain, and a value 
	above 1 will increase the gain of the audio.

--scale-l <float>::
	Same as --scale, but only affects the left channel. 

--scale-r <float>::
	Same as --scale, but only affects the right channel. 


Output Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-m, --mode <string>
	Choose the mode of the resulting audio. Default is auto.
	's' stereo
	'd' dual channel
	'j' joint stereo
	'm' mono
	'a' auto - choose mode automatically based on the input

-a::
	downmix from stereo to mono
	if the incoming file is stereo, combine the audio into 
	a single channel

-p [int]
	which psy model to use (default '1')
	Different models for the psychoacoustics
	Models: -1 to 4

-b [int]
	the total bitrate 	
	For 48/44.1/32kHz default = 192 
	For 24/22.05/16kHz default = 96

-v [int]
	Switch on VBR mode.
	The higher the number the better the quality.
	Useful range -10 to 10.
	See README.VBR for details.

-f 	
	fast mode turns off calculation of the psychoacoustic model.
	Instead a set of default values are assumed

-q [int]
	quick mode calculates the psy model every 'num' frames.

-E
	Store peak energy information at the end of each frame


Miscellaneous Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-d emp
	de-emphasis (default 'n')
-c 	
	mark as copyright
-o
	mark as original
-e
	add error protection
-r
	force padding bits off
-D [int]
	add DAB extensions with an XPAD length as specified.
-t [int]
	'talkativity' setting. 0 = no message. 3 = too much information


EXAMPLES
--------

	twolame sound.wav

This will encode sound.wav to sound.mp2 using the default bitrate of 192 kbps 
and using the default psychoacoustic model (model 3)

	twolame -p 2 -v 5 sound.wav newfile.mp2

Encode sound.wav to newfile.mp2 using psychoacoustic model 2 and encoding
with variable bitrate. The high value of the "-v" argument means that 
the encoding will tend to favour higher bitrates.


	twolame -p 2 -v -5 sound.wav newfile.mp2

Same as example above, except that the negative value of the "-v" argument
means that the lower bitrates will be favoured over the higher ones.
