TODO
====

- not sure if encode_frame() in toolame.c is correct
    frame of mpeg1 is only 576 samples, not 1152 ?
- revamp frontend - GNU style long options, more integrated libsndfile
- Fix broken energy level support
- Fix broken DAB support
- Change documentation from asciidoc to POD
- Re-add support for encoding from stdin when sndfile is available
- Automatic downmixing / upmixing (toolame_set_num_channels)
- Add libresample support to libtoolame (toolame_set_in_samplerate etc.)
- parameter checking in toolame.c using assert
- full options checking in toolame_init_params
- Add a new toolame.spec
- Create Debian packages
- write a frontend conversant with the BWF (Broadcast Wave Format) specification
- quite a lot of duplicated code between toolame_encode_buffer_interleaved
  and toolame_encode_buffer
- sort out changing parameter for toolame_set_VBR_q from FLOAT to int
- set num_ancillary_bits in libtoolame, not front end

- Update documentation

- with this VBR mode, we know the bits aren't going to run out, so we can 
  just assign them "greedily".
- VBR_a_bit_allocation() is yet to be written :)

- Sort out tab size / space mixture in source files

- Add a layer 2 decoder ? mpglib ?
